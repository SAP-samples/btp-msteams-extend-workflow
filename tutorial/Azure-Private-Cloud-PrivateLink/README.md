## Business Process Flow

The target application will provide the SAP Business User to be able to perform ERP operations via MS Teams. Below depicts the business process flow.

![plot](../../images/Processflow.png)

1. User creates Purchase Requisition in SAP S/4HANA system and a workflow is started in the SAP S/4HANA system for the release of PR.
2. A background job is running in SAP S/4HANA system that will pick the PR workflow instance and send the PR creation Event to SAP Event Mesh.
3. Extension App deployed on BTP receives this event by using web hook utility.
4. Extension App fetches additional details of the Purchase Requisition by querying the SAP S/4HANA via Destination service and Private Link.
5. Extension App sends the notification to the corresponding approver of the PR via MS Teams using the Azure Bot Service.
6. The Approver can Approve/Reject the PR by clicking a button in MS teams notification that calls the Extension App.
7. Extension App sends the Approval/Rejection status to SAP S/4HANA system.

### BTP Configuration

***Create Destinations***<br>
We describe a set of Destinations, whereas the first one refers to the initial simple setup discussed in part 1 of the blog series. The next two are required to realize the SAMLAssertion flow. This additional complexity is due to the fact that the SAML2BearerAssertion flow cannot be used, because the BTP Private Link Service operates isolated from all other BTP services by design. As part of the flow the connectivity service would need to reach the OAuth2 server on the SAP backend but can't because it has no visibility of the private endpoint.

We could get away with 2 destinations, because the target configuration is the same except the authorization header. For a cleaner approach and better separation use a separate instance to avoid overriding authentication.

Open the BTP Cockpit in your browser and log in with your account admin.
Navigate to your BTP Subaccount and select **Connectivity** –  **Destinations** from the left side navigation menu.

1. Create a destination with name "s4BasicAuth"

Click New **Destination** and enter the following configuration values

key | value |
--- | --- |
Name | s4BasicAuth |
Type | HTTP |
URL | <https://[your> private hostname]/ |
Proxy Type | PrivateLink |
Authentication | Basic Authentication (TEAMSCLIENT) |
scope | ZTASKPROCESSING_0002 |
>Note: **TEAMSCLIENT** is the user that you created in the previous steps for the OAuth Client.
### Additional Properties

key | value |
--- | --- |
sap-client | your client no |
TrustAll | true |
HTML5.DynamicDestination | true |
WebIDEEnabled | true |
WebIDEUsage | odata_abap |

2. Create a destination with name "s4oauth" ( This is used to request SAMLAssertion from SAP backend (OAuth server))

key | value |
--- | --- |
Name | s4oauth |
Type | HTTP |
URL | <https://[your private hostname]/sap/bc/sec/oauth2/token?sap-client=[your client no] > |
Proxy Type | PrivateLink |
Authentication | SAMLAssertion |
Audience | check Provider Name on **SAML2 backend transaction** |
AuthnContextClassRef | urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:ac:classes:x509 |

### Additional Properties

key | value |
--- | --- |
sap-client | your client no |
TrustAll | true |
HTML5.DynamicDestination | true |
WebIDEEnabled | true |
WebIDEUsage | odata_abap |
nameIdFormat | urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress |
tokenServiceURL  | <https://[your private hostname]/sap/bc/sec/oauth2/token > |
assertionRecipient  | <https://[your private hostname]/sap/bc/sec/oauth2/token >|
userSourceId  | email

3. Create destination "s4NoAuth" (This is used for final call to OData without Authentication, we inject the Bearer token from preceeding calls)

key | value |
--- | --- |
Name | s4NoAuth |
Type | HTTP |
URL | identical to first destination |
Proxy Type | PrivateLink |
Authentication | No Authentication |

### Additional Properties

key | value |
--- | --- |
sap-client | your client no |
TrustAll | true |
HTML5.DynamicDestination | true |
WebIDEEnabled | true |
WebIDEUsage | odata_abap |
