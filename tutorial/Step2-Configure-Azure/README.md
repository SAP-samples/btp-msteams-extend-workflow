## Setup and Configurations in Microsoft Azure Platform and MS Teams

We will maintain app users and groups within the Microsoft Azure environment, define application registration, and configure trust between Microsoft Azure and SAP BTP.
The list of Azure components that we will configure is as below

    Azure Active Directory instance with admin acess
    Valid Azure subscription
    Azure Bot service instance
    Azure Storage account for bot to persist information
    Microsoft Teams subscription


If you don't have access to a Microsoft Azure account (including a paid or trial subscription), check out the [tutorial](https://open.sap.com/courses/btpma1/items/1f82kP2dhVdZ6e9xia10A8) in the latest openSAP course [Building Applications on SAP BTP with Microsoft Services](https://open.sap.com/courses/btpma1/). 

It explains in detail how to create a new Microsoft Azure account and get a free trial subscription.

Register at [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and get started with configurations. 

Once you have registred, you will be able to see the below list of services in portal.azure.com
![plot](./images/azure-services.png) 



## 1. Azure Services - Azure Active Directory
Go to Azure Services and select Azure Active Directory. You should be able to see the below information in the Overview of Default Directory.

The default directory as below 
![plot](./images/default-directory.png)

Option to create and manage tenants
![plot](./images/tenant-defaultdirectory.png)


## 2. Establish trust between Azure AD and SAP BTP
The key pillar of the Principal Propagation process is the trust between your Azure Active Directory and your SAP BTP subaccount. This trust needs to be established by you within the Azure AD and your SAP BTP subaccount.

Please check [this tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-azure-ad-saml.html#716a684a-b8fd-4d5b-9472-ba0cc82c01e3) on how to establish trust between Microsoft Azure Active Directory and an SAP BTP subaccount.


> Important: Please check the below configurations once more. Make sure while following the configuration process in Azure AD, you need to change the Reply URI in the SAML configuration from SAML/SSO to oAuth/token. This is mandatory to set the correct recipient URI in the SAML assertion.

![plot](./images/basic-saml-config.png)

Furthermore, ensure that the user's email address (user. mail) is used as the Unique User Identifier (Name ID). Also, feel free to add additional claims if required, as depicted in the below screenshot.
![plot](./images/attributes-claims.png)

**Disable User Logon**
Once the **trust is configured** in Azure AD and SAP BTP, you can disable the BTP **Logon** using this IdP for users. The Azure AD IdP trust is only required for **technical purposes** (in this case, the Principal Propagation). Please make sure that the checkbox for creating **Shadow Users** is **checked**.

![plot](./images/trust-config.png)

Now that the trust is established between Azure AD( productive / trial account) to SAP BTP on Azure(productive/trial account )), let us proceed with mapping role collection mapping as the next step.

## 3. Create Group and Test Users in Azure AD

## Groups in Azure 
Go to Default Directory and click on Groups - New Group.
Create a new security group with the name s4businessusergrp.</br>
![plot](./images/azure-groups.png)

All users supposed to use the new extension application have to be assigned to this group. 

The Object ID of this user group will later be mapped to a role collection in SAP BTP. So, before you move on, please note down the Object ID from the SAP BTP -> Trust Configurations -> Role Collection - Overview section. The group assignment of your Active Directory users will be provided to SAP BTP using the Groups claim of your SAML configuration. 

## Create users in Azure
Go to Default Directory and click on Users - New User, as shown below.
![plot](./images/azure-users.png)

Ensure the email id is updated for the newly created user. This field is important and required when we are receiving the events from SAP S/4HANA.
![plot](./images/useremail.png)

## Assign the users to the group
![plot](./images/user-group-assignment.png)

## 4. Enterprise application user (group) assignment

Go back to the default directory and select the enterprise application that was created when you set up the trust between Azure AD and SAP BTP.
![plot](./images/enterprise-app.png)

Hint â€“ Please be aware that if you're using a free Azure Active Directory, you have to add all (test) users manually, as groups cannot be added. Nevertheless, the previous group assignment will be available in SAP BTP via the configured SAML claim.

Please see the below screenshot for the same. For a trial account, the assignment will look at below.
![plot](./images/enterpriseapp-users.png)

In case of paid subscription , the assignment will look at below 
![plot](./images/enterprise app-users.png)

The required Role Collection Mapping on the SAP BTP side will be done in one of the next steps.

## 5. SAP BTP Role Collection Mapping

Please check: In the SAP BTP configurations, you would have created a role collection s4hana_procurement. You will need to update this Role collection with the GroupID detail from Azure.

Copy the Group ID from the created group (s4businessusersgrp)
![plot](./images/objectid-group.png)

Go to your SAP BTP Account Cockpit - Select Subaccount - go to Security -> Trust Configuration, 
![plot](./images/btp-trustconfig.png)


Open the Role Collection Mapping for Azure Identity Provider. In this case, we look at the trialAzureAD. Update the ObjectID details to as value against the attribute Group as shown below,
 ![plot](./images/sapbtp-rolecollection.png)

All MS Teams users supposed to use the extension application have to be assigned to this Azure AD group. This mapping allows the users (once their identity has been propagated to SAP BTP) to SAP S/4HANA based on their Principal Propagation identity.

Now that we have enabled the trust between SAP BTP and Microsoft Azure and 
Please perform the steps given in the [Get your Microsoft Azure settings ready](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/28/sap-ms-teams-7-get-your-microsoft-azure-settings-ready/) blog post on getting Microsoft Azure ready for registration of an application for MS Teams Extension.

You can refer to the above blog, where similar steps and detailed explanations are provided for the Success Factors Integration example. Here we have provided similar steps in the Azure trial account and provided a screenshot for your quick reference.

Please ensure you read this blog post to understand each of the configuration details mentioned below. You will need to refer to the blog post for the below steps.

## 6. Register an application for Microsoft Teams Extension

## 7. Create Azure Bot Service

Go to the home screen at http://portal.azure.com and search for the marketplace.
![plot](./images/marketplace.png)

Look for Azure Bot and start to create.
![plot](./images/azurebot.png)

Once you have the Azure Bot has been created, go ahead and add Microsoft Teams to the connected channels and complete all the configurations as mentioned in the blog post.

You should be able to see the final configurations below
![plot](./images/botconfigs.png)

Click on Test Connection and test both the OAuth connection settings (GraphConnection and BTPConnection).

When testing the connection, when prompted for user credentials, use the test user created.
We are using Test User to test the connection.
![plot](./images/azure-users.png)

## 8. Create Azure Storage Account

The next step is to create the Azure Storage Account.
![plot](./images/storageaccount.png)

Click on Advanced Tab and make sure the blob public access is disabled before clicking on Review+Create.

Once the storage account is successfully created, go to the resource and add a container and note down the connection strings from the Access Keys.

![plot](./images/containers-keys.png)

Note down the container name and the connection string from the configuration. This will be used in environmental variables.
![plot](./images/containername.png)
![plot](./images/accesskeys.png)

## 8. Login to MS Teams 

With the test user, you created, login to [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/). You should be able to see the below screen 
![plot](./images/teamslogin.png)

In case you do not see this, then check for details in the blog post under Section - Microsoft Teams licence. You can assign the licence to the AD users.

This completes all the configurations on the Azure side.
We will need to revisit and update a few configurations after we complete the deployment of the SAP BTP Extension application.
