## Configure Microsoft Azure Platform and MS Teams

You will maintain application users and groups within the Microsoft Azure AD, define application registration, and configure trust between Microsoft Azure AD and SAP BTP.
These are the Microsoft Azure components you will configure:

    Azure Active Directory instance with admin access
    Valid Azure subscription
    Azure Bot service instance
    Azure Storage account for bot to persist information
    Microsoft Teams subscription


If you don't have access to a Microsoft Azure account (including a paid or trial subscription), check out the [tutorial](https://open.sap.com/courses/btpma1/items/1f82kP2dhVdZ6e9xia10A8) in the latest openSAP course [Building Applications on SAP BTP with Microsoft Services](https://open.sap.com/courses/btpma1/). 

It explains in detail how to create a new Microsoft Azure account and get a free trial subscription.

Register at [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and get started with the configurations. 

Once you have registered, you will be able to see the following list of Azure services in portal.azure.com
![plot](./images/azure-services.png) 



## 1. Create tenant in Microsoft Azure - Azure Active Directory
Login to [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). Select Azure Active Directory. You should be able to see the below information in the Overview of Default Directory.

Below is the option to create and manage tenants
![plot](./images/tenant-defaultdirectory.png)


## 2. Establish trust between Azure AD and SAP BTP
The key pillar of the Principal Propagation process is the trust between your Azure Active Directory and your subaccount in SAP BTP. This trust needs to be established by you within the Azure AD and your subaccount in SAP BTP.

For more information, check step 7 of the [Integrate Microsoft Azure AD with SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Environment](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-azure-ad-saml.html#716a684a-b8fd-4d5b-9472-ba0cc82c01e3) tutorial.

> Important: Check the Basic SAML configuration in Azure Active Directory again. Make sure you have changed the Reply URI from SAML/SSO to OAuth/token. It is mandatory to set the correct recipient URI in the SAML assertion.

![plot](./images/basic-saml-config.png)

Furthermore, ensure that the user's email address (user. mail) is used as the Unique User Identifier (Name ID). Also, feel free to add additional claims if required, as depicted in the screenshot below.
![plot](./images/attributes-claims.png)

**Disable User Logon**
Once the trust is configured between Azure AD and SAP BTP, you can disable the BTP **Logon** using this IdP for users. The Azure AD IdP trust is only required for **technical purposes** (in this case, the Principal Propagation). Please make sure that the checkbox for creating **Shadow Users** is **checked**.

![plot](./images/trust-config.png)

Now that the trust is established between Azure Active Directory(productive or trial account) to SAP BTP, let us proceed with mapping role collection mapping as the next step.

## 3. Create Group and Test Users in Azure AD

## 3.1 Create groups in Azure AD
Login to Azure Portal.Go to Default Directory and click on Groups - New Group.
Create a new security group with the name s4businessusergrp.</br>
![plot](./images/azure-groups.png)

All users supposed to use the new extension application have to be assigned to this group. 

The Object ID of this user group will later be mapped to a role collection in SAP BTP. So, before you move on, please note down the Object ID from the Azure Portal. for creating a new role collection in overview section of SAP BTP Trust Configuration.
The group assignment of your Active Directory users will be provided to SAP BTP using the Groups claim of your SAML configuration. 

## 3.2 Create users in Azure
Go to Default Directory and click on Users - New User, as shown below.
![plot](./images/azure-users.png)

Ensure the email id is updated for the newly created user. This field is important for principal propogation and is required when receiving the events from SAP S/4HANA.The same ID will be configured for the named user in SAP S/4HANA.
![plot](./images/useremail.png)

## 3.3 Assign the users to the group
Select the group and add the list of users.
![plot](./images/user-group-assignment.png)

## 4. Assign users and groups to enterprise application

Go back to the default directory and select the enterprise application that was created when you set up the trust between Azure AD and SAP BTP.
![plot](./images/enterprise-app.png)

Hint â€“ Please be aware that if you're using a free Azure Active Directory, you have to add all (test) users manually, as groups cannot be added. Nevertheless, the previous group assignment will be available in SAP BTP via the configured SAML claim.

Please see the below screenshot for the same. For a trial account, the assignment will look at below.
![plot](./images/enterpriseapp-users.png)

In case of paid subscription , the assignment will look at below 
![plot](./images/enterpriseapp-users-paid.png)

The required Role Collection Mapping on the SAP BTP side will be done in the next steps.

## 5. Create SAP BTP Role Collection Mapping

Copy the Group ID from the created group (s4businessusersgrp) from Azure Portal.
![plot](./images/objectid-group.png)

Go to your SAP BTP Account Cockpit - Select Subaccount - go to Security -> Trust Configuration, 
![plot](./images/btp-trustconfig.png)


Open the Role Collection Mappings for Azure Identity Provider. In this case, we look at the trialAzureAD. Update the ObjectID details to as value against the attribute Group as shown below,
 ![plot](./images/sapbtp-rolecollection.png)

All MS Teams users supposed to use the extension application have to be assigned to this Azure AD group. This mapping allows the users (once their identity has been propagated to SAP BTP) to SAP S/4HANA based on their Principal Propagation identity.

Now that we have enabled the trust between SAP BTP and Microsoft Azure and 
Please perform the steps given in the [Get your Microsoft Azure settings ready](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/02/28/sap-ms-teams-7-get-your-microsoft-azure-settings-ready/) blog post on getting Microsoft Azure ready for registration of an application for MS Teams Extension.

You can refer to the above blog, where similar steps and detailed explanations are provided for the Success Factors Integration example. Here we have provided similar steps in the Azure trial account and provided a screenshot for your quick reference.
