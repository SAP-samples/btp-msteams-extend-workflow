## Scenario:
The business scenario you will be implementing here will allow SAP enterprise business users to perform the ERP operations from MS Teams. Business Users can receive alerts/events from SAP S/4HANA for approvals and rejection.     

## Business Process Flow 
The target application will provide the SAP Business User with the ability to perform ERP operations via MS Teams. Below depicts the business process flow.

![plot](./images/BusinessProcess.png)

1. User creates Purchase Requisition in SAP S/4HANA system, and a workflow is started in the SAP S/4HANA system to release PR. 
2. A background job running in the SAP S/4HANA system will pick the PR workflow instance and send the PR creation Event to SAP Event Mesh.
3. Extension App deployed on SAP BTP receives this event via webhook utility.
4. Extension App fetches additional details of the Purchase Requisition by querying the SAP S/4HANA via Destination service and SAP Connectivity Service.
5. Extension App sends the notification to the corresponding approver of the PR via MS Teams using the Azure Bot Service.
6. The Approver can Approve/Reject the PR with a click of a button in the MS teams notification that calls the Extension App.
7. Extension App sends the Approval/Rejection status to the SAP S/4HANA System.


## Solution Architecture

Below is the high-level solution architecture for SAP S/4HANA on-premise / any other Hyperscalers ( AWS, GCP). 

The key services leveraged from Microsoft Azure are Bot Service, Blob Storage, MS Graph, Teams App Registration, Extension App Registration and Azure AD.

The services leveraged from SAP BTP are SAP Cloud Foundry Runtime, SAP Event Mesh, SAP Connectivity Service, and Destination Service. 


### Recommended Architecture connect to SAP S/4HANA on-premise / any other hyperscaler using SAP BTP Connectivity Service.

![plot](./images/Architecture-CC.png)

The architecture below leverages the SAP Cloud Connector and SAP Connectivity Service to establish secured communication between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA seamlessly. We will see how the communication and flow of information work. 
Principal propagation of the users is enabled using XSUAA. 
Let us quickly understand how communication happens among the different systems and approaches for the principal propagation of users.

1 – When a user signs into MS Teams and starts the bot, the bot handler (part of the extension application running on SAP BTP) is called and asks the Microsoft Teams client to obtain an authentication token for the current user by sending a so-called OAuthCard to the client.

2 – The Microsoft Teams client fulfils this request and obtains a bot application token from Azure Active Directory using the session of the current Microsoft Teams user. This process might require an initial login on the first usage of the extension application, including a potential consent for scopes or a Multi-Factor authentication (MFA).

3 – If the current session can be used to obtain a valid token from Azure Active Directory, this bot application token is sent to the Microsoft Teams client, which sends it back to the bot handler of your extension application. Depending on the data required, this token can now be exchanged for an application access token, including scopes for Microsoft Graph or a custom scope allowing you to obtain a SAML Assertion for SAP BTP access (more details will be provided later!).

4 – In the case of SAP BTP access, the extension application/bot handler exchanges the application access token for a SAML Assertion containing the user's attributes and unique identifier. The so-called On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow (click here) is used for this step. Obtaining a valid SAML Assertion is based on a trust configuration between SAP BTP and your Azure Active Directory.

5 – The SAML Assertion is sent to the SAP BTP authorization server (XSUAA) to receive an access token for the SAP BTP environment. This token request needs to contain a valid Client Id and Secret, which is taken from a service key of the XSUAA Instance. This process of exchanging a SAML Assertion provided by one platform for a valid token of another platform follows the RFC 7522 standard (click here).

6 – Using the access token received by XSUAA in exchange for the SAML Assertion, the extension application/bot handler can now call the OData Services from SAP S/4HANA with the propagated user identity.

7 – The oData services are executed, and the result is sent to the extension application. The OData requests are secured by a standardized OAuth2 SAML Bearer Assertion, allowing the required Principal Propagation on the last mile.

Note: Principal propagation configurations can be set up, which is optional. For testing purposes, you can proceed if you want to execute the scenario with Basic Authentication. However, this is not recommended.

### Recommended Architecture to connect to SAP S/4HANA on Azure using SAP BTP Private Link Service and Azure Private Link

![plot](./images/Architecture-PL.png)

The architecture below leveraging the SAP Private Link Service in SAP BTP and Azure Private Link for connectivity helps seamlessly establish secured communication between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA. 

Please look for detailed documentation in the tutorials folder - Azure-Private-Cloud-PrivateLink folder in case you want to setup as per this architecture. You will also need to perform all the steps mentioned in the Implementation Section. 
Note: Principal propagation configurations should be set up, which is not optional. We will be updating the codebase to support Basic Authentication for testing purposes; however, this is not recommended.


## Requirements 
Below are the technical prerequistics for a successful Microsoft Teams - SAP S/4HANA integration. Primarily, we will need SAP S/4HANA configured for Purchase Requisitions and Approvals, SAP Business Technology Platform and Microsoft Azure. Below is the list of configurations and services required to implement the end-to-end business flow.

**SAP S/4HANA On-Premise**
- 2 business users ( 1st  for the requestor, 2nd for the approver) 

**SAP Business Technology Platform Services**
- Cloud Foundry Subaccount
    > - Foundation for running the MS Teams extension application.
    > - Required for Azure AD - SAP BTP trust
- Memory/Runtime quota
    > - Required to host the MS Teams extension application
- Authorization & Trust Management Service
    > - Secure MS Teams extension application endpoints


**Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Teams Subscription**
- A valid Azure subscription
- An Azure Active Directory
    > - Required for Azure AD - SAP BTP trust
    > - Microsoft user and authorization management
    > - Contains user profile information (email, names, pictures)
    > - Application registrations to allow Graph API and SAP BTP access

- Microsoft Graph API
    > - Used to retrieve user profile information and MS Teams data (chat members, team members also.)

- An Azure Bot Service
    > - Services for Azure bots (e.g. Application Insights)
    > - Bot connection between extension app and Microsoft Teams

- An Azure Storage Account
    > - Storing of Conversation References for notifications

- A MS Teams subscription
    > - Required for paid services like Azure Storage Account

**MISC**

- SAP BTP - Azure AD trust
    > - A trust between SAP BTP and Azure AD (vice versa) has to be established

- Admin users in all landscapes
    > - The implementation requires admin users in all landscapes (SAP BTP, Microsfot Azure, MS Teams)

- Mapping based on an email address
    > - The users in both systems need the same email address

Let us get started with development!

## Known Issues

Below are some known issues and updates that need to be considered during implementation. There will be updates to the repository and updates for the below. Please do pull the latest version and redeploy the application to SAP BTP.

Mobile device optimization
    The adaptive cards are not yet optimized for picture-perfect mobile rendering. Whereas the functionality is given, the appearance of the mobile interface could be improved. This could be another challenge when optimizing the extension app for your personal needs.

User and admin consent
    User and a potential admin consent have not been in scope for this application. Please ensure you're granting admin consent in Azure Active Directory for the application registration to prevent potential consent issues when calling APIs.
